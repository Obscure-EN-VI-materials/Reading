**ENERGY REQUIREMENTS**  
As human being, we depend on energy in many ways.  
1\.  \_\_\_\_B\_\_\_\_

Eating requires energy for the ingestion and digestion of what we put in our mouths, and for the absorption, transport, interconverstion, oxidation and deposition of nutrients. These metabolic processes increase heat production and oxygen consumption, and are known by term such as  dietary-induced thermogenesis, specific dynamic action of food and thermic effect of feeding. The metabolic response to nutrition increases total energy expenditure by about 10 per cent of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) over a 24-hour period in individual eating a mixed diet.  

2\.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is the most variable and, after BMR, the second largest component of daily energy expenditure. Humans perform  obligatory  and  discretionary  physical activities. Obligatory activities can seldom be avoided within a given setting, and they are imposed on the individual by economic, cultural and societal demands. The term “obligatory” is more comprehensive than the term “occupational” that was used in the 1985 report (WHO, 1985) because, in addition to occupational work, obligatory activities include daily activities such as going to school, tending to the home and family and other demands made on children and adults by their economic, social and cultural environment. 

3\.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Discretionary activities, although not socially or economically essential, are important for health, well- being and a good quality of life in general. They include the regular practice of physical activity for fitness and health; the performance of optional household tasks that may contribute to family comfort and well- being; and the engagement in individually and socially desirable activities for personal enjoyment, social interaction and community development. 

4\.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The energy cost of growth has two components: 1) the energy needed to synthesize growing tissues; and 2) the energy deposited in those tissues. The energy cost of growth is about 35 per cent of total energy requirement during the first three months of age, falls rapidly to about 5 per cent at 12 months and about 3 per cent in the second year, remains at 1 to 2 per cent until mid-adolescence, and is negligible in the late teens. 

5\.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

During pregnancy, extra energy is needed for the growth of the foetus, placenta and various maternal tissues, such as in the  uterus, breasts and fat stores, as well as for changes in maternal metabolism and the increase in maternal effort at rest and during physical activity. 

6\.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The energy cost of lactation has two components: 1) the energy content of this food for the baby; and 2) the energy required in its production. Well-nourished lactating women can derive part of this additional requirement from body fat stores accumulated during pregnancy.
